This project is to build a recommendation system predicting user rating using collaborative filtering and various models. The following were considered when determining the optimal model:
1. Voting & helpful_vote
2. Rounding of rating prediction
3. Training model algorithm

Various model are fitted and compared against each other. The results are measured by using metrics: RMSE, MAE. Further discussion would be held in the pdf report.

A comparison between different models are summarized in the table shown at the bottom: SVD model with tuned parameters has the best performance.
