# README: Recommendation System Project

## Overview

This project aims to build a recommendation system that predicts user ratings using collaborative filtering and various models. The following factors were considered when determining the optimal model:

1. **Voting & Helpful Vote**: Incorporating user votes and helpfulness scores.
2. **Rounding of Rating Prediction**: Adjusting the predicted ratings to match the rating scale.
3. **Training Model Algorithm**: Evaluating different algorithms for training the recommendation model.

## Methodology

### Factors Considered

- **Voting & Helpful Vote**: The impact of user votes and helpfulness scores on the prediction accuracy was analyzed.
- **Rounding of Rating Prediction**: Different rounding techniques were applied to the predicted ratings.
- **Training Model Algorithm**: Various algorithms were tested and compared.

### Models and Evaluation

Various models were fitted and compared against each other. The results were measured using the following metrics:
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**

Further discussions and detailed analysis are provided in the accompanying PDF report.

### Best Performing Model

A comparison between different models is summarized in the table at the bottom of the report. The SVD model with tuned parameters has the best performance based on the evaluation metrics.

## Summary

This README provides an overview of the recommendation system project, highlighting the key factors considered, the methodology used, and the evaluation metrics. The detailed performance comparisons and further discussions are available in the PDF report.
